Prompt
~~~~~~

An angry investor sent us a note about how they keep getting squeezed down to $25K per deal even
though their requested amount is $100K. Underneath the hood, this was because there's limited
allocation (low supply) and a high volume of investors looking to invest (high demand). How should
we communicate this to an investor in a way that minimizes the damage to our relationship with
the investor?

In addition, can you think of a better way we could change the proration basis logic so that
this could potentially happen less often?

Response

Step 1: Empathy first. Call them!
No, this wont scale. No, this wont likely fix the underlying pain. But this will give us better information on what a truly activated Customer wants. 

This person has $100K to invest within our product, that's not something we can ignore. Embrace their value and listen. This call is important as it:

- Instills trust in the Customer (We care)
- Provides direct feeback on our current product (We're listeninng)
- and Keeps the Customer active (We're engauged)


Step 2: Expectation Setting
We have failed to show this Customer why their investment cannot be the maximum amount they have requested. 

Let's fix this going forward.

- Perhaps we better message with videos on how allocations are calculated
- Perhaps we change our process to include a human connection to explain the process
- Perhaps we have a live calculator on the app that shows the real investment amount in relation to all other investments

Let's knock together a test for each of these and see what sticks. And let's include this angery Investor if they're willing.


Step 3: Learning and Adapting
Depending on the feedback we get, we could go a few different ways with proration. Doing this based onn the historical average seems the most fair today, but we could explore:

- Allowing the Startup to pick a model
    - Historical Proration (default)
    - First come, first served
    - Hand Picked

- A super premium option where verified (and paying) Investors could always get a higher propotion allocated

- Pooling Investors across a portfolio of Startups
